                    <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>

                    <p class="single-block-text">Based on each search engine’s unique algorithm, your site will be ranked and your
                        SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) results returned based upon keyword requests
                        from users. Search engines send out little programmes known as 'robots' or 'bots' or
                        'spiders' to crawl the Internet in search of websites and their individual web pages.</p>
                    <p class="single-block-text">These programmes gather all the information on your website that they can find, or
                        that you allow them to see. Information gathered by search engine bots then gets
                        cached (stored) in the search engine's servers, where the web pages are categorised
                        in order of importance. Search engines classify the content on web pages by using
                        reference points such as the page title, description, paragraph headers, and other
                        usability information. </p>

                    <p class="single-block-text">Search engines always strive to deliver the most
                        relevant results to the search request the user has
                        made. A search engine that consistently delivers
                        good results gets visited more often, and gains trust
                        in the eyes of the user. One of the ways that Google
                        became so successful was that it found ways to index
                        credible websites while eliminating search results
                        that were less relevant. One of Google's methods for
                        establishing user trust has been to count the quantity and quality of links to any
                        given website from other pages on the Internet, and to use a formula for doing this
                        automatically. This formula is known as the Google Algorithm. This algorithm is
                        constantly changed and tweaked to provide the best user experience in terms of
                        producing highly relevant results, and also to thwart unscrupulous use of 'black hat'
                        search engine optimisation techniques to 'game' the system in an attempt to
                        position web pages higher in the rankings than they would naturally occur. </p>


                    <h2 class="blog-header">Natural Search Results </h2>
                    <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>
                    <p class="single-block-text">The natural search results are those organic results that are generated by search
                        engine searches and are listed directly below the sponsored ads. In addition to your
                        actual website, other things can appear in the natural search results.For this reason, you need to pay attention to the use of keywords in the following because they are all commonly found ranked in natural search results: Articles, Off-site blogs, Press releases, Social networking profiles, Social bookmarking profiles and videos.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-header">How Will People Search for You?</h2>
                    <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>

                    <p class="single-block-text">What types of phrasing will potential customers use when searching for you? Will
                        they look for a person, position, a firm or a solution? Will they use geographic
                        modifiers like city or county? Will their level of motivation come through in their
                        search, by using specific words?

                        <ul>
                            <li class="single-block-text-li">Specific person: “Plumber”, “plumbing contractor”, etc.</li>
                            <li class="single-block-text-li">Geographic modifiers: “plumber”, “plumber Cork”</li>
                            <li class="single-block-text-li">Motivation levels: “emergency plumber Cork”, “24 hour plumber”.</li>

                        </ul>


                        <p class="single-block-text">As a critical part of your keyword research, you should employ a keyword research. While there are a variety of such tools on the market, <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/" class="block-link">Google AdWords</a> has a free
                            one that can help greatly, as it generates keyword ideas for you, as well as
                            synonyms
                            tool.

                        </p>

                        <p class="single-block-text">Cross-reference your keywords with geographic modifiers. If your business is in
                            Cork, as in the plumber example, people too far away most likely won’t call your
                            business to engage your services. That’s where geographic modifiers come in. City
                            names, county names and countries are all geographic modifiers. Your audience is
                            likely to search for your business using these geographic modifiers or terms because
                            they want to find somebody locally that can fulfill their needs. This means that in
                            your keyword research process, you should also include geography as part of your
                            criteria.

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="blog-header"> Choosing a Domain Name</h2>
                        <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>

                        <p class="single-block-text">Branding your business by means of your domain name is important. Choosing a
                            domain name that is easy to recognise and easy to find means that your online
                            presence will be much more dynamic. Great domains are ones that have your main
                            service or product type and your location in them.

                        </p>


                        <p class="single-block-text">For example, if your main service is the provision of liposuction and your clinic is in
                            Cork, the perfect web domain would be www.LiposuctionCork.ie, or a variation
                            of this. You may have to do some digging to get a good domain name. Another
                            alternative is to see if the name of your business is available as a domain name.

                        </p>


                        <h2 class="blog-header"> Meta Tags</h2>
                        <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>

                    <p class="single-block-text">The<a href="https://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags" class="block-link"> meta tags</a> are a very important part of the code of your website. They are readby the search engines, but are not visible as part of your web page content as theyare in the code of the website. When your meta tags are properly configured thisgives the search engines a concise summary of the web page content so the searchengines understand what your website is about and rank it accordingly.Most meta tags are included within the 'header' html code of a website. The mostimportant tags are the title, description and keywords.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="blog-header"> Backlinking</h2>
                        <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>

                        <p class="single-block-text">In search engine optimisation (SEO), backlinks refer to hyperlinks pointing to a
                            particular web page. <a href="https://www.hostpapa.be/blog/marketing/how-to-get-quality-backlinks-to-your-website/" class="block-link">Backlinks</a> are important to SEO because search engine
                            considers the quality and quantity of backlinks to determine page rank.
                            Here is how backlinking works, some of the different types of links there are and
                            how they all pull together to move your key phrases and their associated web pages
                            up through the search engine rankings.

                        </p>

                        <p class="single-block-text">Not all links are created equal. Google and the other search engines have a rating
                            system whereby a link coming from a website with a high page rank is considered to
                            be far more important than a link coming from a website or blog with a low page
                            rank. For example, one link from a website with a page rank of 9 would be worth
                            thousands of individual links coming from blogs with a page rank of 0.

                        </p>

                        <p class="single-block-text">YouTube is another site with a high authority ranking. Uploading well optimised
                            videos with a link back to your website has always been considered a good strategy
                            for high quality backlinks, especially since Google is the owner of YouTube!


                        </p>

                        <p class="single-block-text">Bookmark links are social links. These will generally give a lower quality of link back
                            to your website, but are necessary to the linking mix. It would look far too unnatural
                            to the search engines to only have links coming to your site and pages from sites
                            with higher page authority. There are literally hundreds of bookmarking sites; some
                            of the better known ones are Del.icio.us, StumbleUpon and Ma.gnolia.
