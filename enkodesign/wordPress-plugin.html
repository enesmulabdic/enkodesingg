                    <p>

                    </p>


                    <p class="single-block-text">Every newbie or a developer has this definite question of choosing the best plugin for their particular WordPress website. Now, adding some more confusions in your mind, let me tell you, according to Codeinwp.com May 2018 statistics, there are 50,000+ plugins and others being added daily. Just imagine out of this gigantic numbers how will you select the most suitable plugin for your website? Will it be fair to say that you select the category and install one by one all plugin and test whether it is good for your website? How foolish idea and immature suggestion would it be, am I right? For this reason, we are going to look at some of the important aspects of selecting the best plugin for your lovely website.</p>

                    <p class="single-block-text">When an experienced developer working on WordPress projects cannot identify the right plugin for a website just because he/she are least capable of solving that problem, but you get around such situation when you are clueless as what can be done? Then what is the fault of newbies who are just touching the walls of WordPress and if they are unable to select the right plugin? Come on man, let’s arrive at the main point of choosing it right with this quick guide.</p>






                    <h2 class="blog-header">What steps to take?</h2>
                    <div class="title-underline4 my-4"></div>
                    <p>
                        <img src="images/blog/single-blog/WordPress_plugin.jpg" alt="WordPress Plugins" class="img-fluid blog-img-blog">
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">1. Identify the Company</h2>
                    <p class="single-block-text-text"> It is very important to know about the company or an individual who has developed a particular plugin. You cannot just blindly select any of them because all are not at the same stage some may be at extreme heights while some may have published their first plugin. So, be careful about that and don’t select so many at a time and ending with none.</p>


                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">2. Created Date</h2>
                    <p class="single-block-text-text">Now, here is something to understand deeper. When you see a specific date mentioned, ex. 2 Januar 2019, the thing is check for the updates and their progress what they have done so far in a year till 2 Januar 2020 and how advanced they have reached. If you find the features same, functionalities not so soothing for a website as it should then think twice to select it.</p>

                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">3. Last Updated</h2>
                    <p class="single-block-text-text">This is one of the most taken into consideration factor while selecting a plugin. You know very that we are faced with lots of security issues and WordPress always suggest to update your theme or plugin as an when asked to. This factor is very important to understand for a developer and a newbie. Many of them often miss out to check the last updated date of a plugin. Suppose, if a plugin was developed a year and a half back on 2th February 2019 and when you see that it was last updated on 28th November 2019 then think twice in moving with that plugin. You know WordPress is releasing regular updates, now in that case, if you install the plugin, you may face problems related compatibility issues, browser compatibility issues, security issues and you know it is an older version of a plugin, you may find that it may clash with other plugins too.</p>
                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">4. Number of Sales</h2>

                    <p class="single-block-text-text">It is also recommended to look at the sales figures for a plugin, this gives you a statistical figure and idea that how popular and good it is at attracting people’s attention. In this case some of the plugins maybe free but to a certain limit. So, here I am talking about the majority of plugins. The more sales number your eyes clicks the more you can rely on it.</p>

                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">5. Comments or Reviews</h2>

                    <p class="single-block-text-text">This has become an integral part today while we purchase anything online. We do not just select an item and pay for it instead we read reviews from the customers who have already purchased that item. This way we get a clear picture whether that item is good or not for yourself. In the same way, read the comments of the people who have purchased a plugin you will get know that where they faced challenges after using a particular plugin.</p>


                    <h2 class="single-block-text-header">6. Customer Support</h2>

                    <p class="single-block-text-text">Last, but an unavoidable factor for everyone is to find out what type of support they provide. It happens sometimes that you purchased a plugin and are unable to install or configure that plugin. In that case, you can take help from the technical team of a plugin to help you solve the issue. Many of us face problems while we migrate to another server or while revamping the website. In that case, sometimes it becomes difficult to configure again a plugin and the only option left for you is to ask for help</p>
